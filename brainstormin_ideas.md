# What To Add Next:

1. Future Stock Price Prediction Algorithm
- Implement models for predicting future prices or returns (regression, time series models).
- Use advanced ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, etc.).

On that note also maybe: Multi-Horizon Signals
- Develop separate models for short-term, medium-term, and long-term investing signals.
- Allow users to select their investment horizon and see tailored predictions.

2. Sentiment Analysis Integration: Combine news sentiment scores with technical indicators for improved predictions.

3. Portfolio Simulation - basically just allowing users to simulate portfolio growth based on generated signals.

Some analysis stuff:
-> Add cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, Sharpe ratio).
